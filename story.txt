Adam is leaving home. He is leaving the old, run-down, flat, and
boring home for the city. He had no plan, however, he still knew
that he had to leave. He couldn't stay in that town any longer.
It was time for a change.

He hopped on the first train that came, without even knowing where it
was going. He rode and rode the train, until it reached the last stop.
He had absolutely no idea where he was. But he didn't regret leaving.
